# ALS_MHE_Results
This repository contains results figures for the 2020 Mechatronics Paper 'Improved Noise Covariance Estimation in Visual Servoing Using an Autocovariance Least-squares Approach'.

The paper figures and error tables are generated by 'Sample Code > genFigures.m'.

The memory efficient ALS code is implemented in the 'MEALS' function.

Only results for the real experiment, along with preprocessed data for that experiment are included here, in the form of matlab figures.
